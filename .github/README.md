# Kharagpur Open Source Society Blog

## How to create a new blog post?

* Create a post inside `posts/` directory.
* Update https://github.com/kossiitkgp/kossiitkgp.org to get it published on the website.

Notes:
 - You should add a line at the bottom about the writer. You can also add if the article exists on your personal blog. e.g. `This article is written by [Ayush Goyal](https://github.com/Defcon-007). This blog post originally appeared at <link_to_your_post>.`
